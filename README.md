# sm-pattern-gen
Small utility for generating 4key streams of non-standard snaps

Currently functional, although very inflexible. To use, download the source code, and then run it using `cargo run`. This will output a measure's worth of notes of the currently hardcoded snap into the terminal.
From there copy and paste the output into a .sm file.

## Current objectives:
- Turn into cli program that accepts cmd arguments.
- Make stream generation smarter.

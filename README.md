# sm-pattern-gen
Small utility for generating 4key streams of non-standard snaps

## Usage
The program requires 2 CLI arguments: first is the snap, e.g. 16th, 48th, 20th; second is the pattern, e.g. stream, jumpstream. 
As an example: `sm_pattern_gen.exe 20th jumpstream` would generate a measure's worth of 20th js. 
You'll have to copy+paste the output in the terminal into the .sm you want to add the notes to.

## Current objectives:
[x] Turn into cli program that accepts cmd arguments.
[] Make stream generation smarter.
